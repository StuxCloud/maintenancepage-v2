# Contributing to maintenancepage-v2

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository is an archived, pinned snapshot of the green-era maintenancepage design, so its scope is intentionally narrow.

## Scope

This is **not** the actively developed template. That's [StuxCloud/maintenancepage](https://github.com/StuxCloud/maintenancepage). This repo preserves the pre-teal `v2` look as-is. Contributions here should keep the existing design working, not change it:

- Fixing broken links, encoding issues, or browser-compatibility bugs
- Keeping the page renderable as browsers and standards evolve

New features, redesigns, or styling changes belong in the live `maintenancepage` repository instead.

## Versioning

This project uses [Date Versioning](https://datevers.ing). To release:

1. Add a `## vYY.MM.DD` entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, with its sections in this order: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security, Deprecated.
2. Set `VERSION.md` to the same bare version (no `v`): today's **UTC** date as `YY.MM.DD`, or `YY.MM.DD-1`, `-2`… for later releases the same UTC day. Never a future date. Use UTC, not local time: just after midnight in the UK it is still the previous day in UTC.
3. Run `bash tests/version.sh`.
4. Run `./commit.sh` (or `commit.bat` on Windows). It checks the version, commits and tags `vYY.MM.DD`, and never pushes.
